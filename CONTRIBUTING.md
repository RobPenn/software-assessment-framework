# How to contribute

## **Do you want to suggest a new metric?**

* We'd love to hear what you think makes good metrics - we're taking suggestions through the GitHub issues system.

* To suggest a new metric:
  1. **Check the metric has not been suggested / implemented already** by searching on GitHub under [Issues with the label "metric"](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ametric)
  2. If it's not there, open a [new issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description of your metric**, with as much relevant information as possible, for instance what category of metric it is, links to background references / material, and a description of what the metric measures. Make sure you apply the **"Metric"** label to the issue.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* We're particularly keen to extend the range of software metrics on offer - take a look at [existing set](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/tree/master/plugins/metric) and extend the [Base Metric class](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/blob/master/plugins/metric/metric.py)

* You could also extend the range of [Repository Helper](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/blob/master/plugins/repository/helper.py) plugins to support new code repositories.

* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues/new) suggesting your change. **On your issue, please include a reproducible case that we can actually run.**

* After you have collected some positive feedback about the change you should start writing code and when your code is ready submit a pull request.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question as a [new issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-assessment-framework/issues/new).

Thanks!
